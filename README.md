## Project Overview

In recent years, the occurrence of drink spiking has increased globally, with college students being the primary targets. Drink spiking involves surreptitiously adding drugs or other substances to someone's drink without their knowledge or consent, which can have serious short and long-term health consequences, including memory loss, inability to speak, and blurred vision.

To address this issue and prevent drink spiking incidents, we have developed the Halo Smart Drink Protector, a battery-powered device that can seal the top of common glass types. It is a portable and user-friendly device that aims to offer a proactive solution to the problem. Halo's innovative features include a detection algorithm with a high success rate and a flexible and adjustable cover that fits various cup sizes. The device is easy to use and can be carried around, making it a convenient option for people who want to prevent drink spiking. We hope that the Halo Smart Drink Protector will be accessible and affordable to everyone who wants to prevent the potential harm caused by drink spiking.

The final product consists of four primary components, which are the Arduino nano 33 BLE, the outer layer cover, an app, and strain gauge sensor. The Arduino has two built-in sensors, a gyroscope and an accelerometer, which can sense rotations and acceleration, and a strain gauge with the amplifying module connected to it. By combining the accelerometer and gyroscope with the strain gauge module, Halo is able to recognize and detect potential cover removals and eliminate false positives, such as simple cup movement. The Arduino is equipped with a Bluetooth module that is capable of sending signals and connecting to the iOS app, which will send a notification to the user whenever the device senses a potential cover removal.
