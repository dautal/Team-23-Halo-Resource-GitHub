### Setup
Each Halo device will have the Arduino with preloaded software. Once published to the App Store, the iOS app installation is simple and can be done by downloading the app from the App Store. The app will ask to access Bluetooth and to enable notifications. Bluetooth is required for the app to operate. The notifications are optional, but it is best to enable them to ensure the user knows when the cover has been removed. 

To install the app without using the App Store: 
* Download the code from the Github repository https://github.com/dautal/HaloApp
* Open the project in Xcode 
* Make the build, connect the device and upload the app onto it
* For the app to be successfully installed from the build, one should let the iOS device trust the developer certificate in the settings.
